# Creating-Data-Mobile-App

Creating mobile app with shiny apps - Created for Course Project in Developing Data Products

The function of this app is to help teachers visually present the class averages during parent teacher conferences at Colegio San Carlos in Chosica, Peru. They will then be able to compare individual students to the class averages across all courses. This app is intended to be upgraded to be able to input a data table of the whole classes scores to output a graph of class averages across all courses.
